# Matrix Multiplication

# Python Code

This code demonstrates how to perform matrix multiplication in Python using nested for loops.

## Getting Started
To use this code, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code as a zip file.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is saved.
3. Run the code by entering the command "python matrix_multiplication.py" in the terminal.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to enter the number of rows and columns for the two matrices you want to multiply.
5. The program will generate random values for the two matrices, perform the multiplication and display the result.

# C++ Code

This C++ code performs matrix multiplication between two matrices entered by the user. It then allows the user to find a specific element of the resulting matrix. Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The user is prompted to enter the dimensions of the first matrix, and a 2D dynamic array arr1 is initialized with those dimensions using nested loops.
2. The user is prompted to enter the dimensions of the second matrix, and a 2D dynamic array arr2 is initialized with those dimensions using nested loops.
3. If the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix, the multiplication is performed, and the resulting matrix is stored in a 2D dynamic array ansArr initialized with the appropriate dimensions.
4. Random values are inserted into arr1 and arr2.
5. The multiplication is performed using three nested loops.
6. The matrices are printed to the console using nested loops.
7. The user is prompted to enter the row and column indices of the element they want to find.
8. If the user enters an invalid index, an error message is displayed.
9. The value of the specified element is found using a loop and printed to the console.

The code uses dynamic memory allocation to create 2D arrays of integers, which can cause memory leaks if not properly managed. It also assumes that the user enters valid dimensions for the matrices and valid indices for the element to find, without any error checking beyond bounds checking. Overall, the code provides a basic implementation of matrix multiplication and element finding, but may need additional error checking and memory management to be considered robust.
